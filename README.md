Our final file is 'Coin Data Analysis.ipynb' which contains simple moving average, exponential weighted mean, and Fisher transform function calls and plots.
Individual functions for SMA and EWM are included in Python scripts. The Fisher transform function is directly in the .ipynb notebook. 
'SMANotebook.ipynb' and 'Fisher Transform-Copy1.ipynb' include code that tinkers with the example data.
